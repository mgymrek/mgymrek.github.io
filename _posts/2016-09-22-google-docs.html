Based on a brief <a href="https://twitter.com/mgymrek/status/714456874091995136">twitter discussion a couple months ago</a>, I decided to make the progressive leap to use Google docs, rather than Microsoft Word, for my first grant proposal. While this had many pros, I'm not yet convinced this was a good idea, and might have been scared away for now.

<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>It feels good not to be a slave to expensive Microsoft products.</li>
<li>Easy to share with collaborators, even if they don't have the money to buy Word. </li>
<li>I can send to multiple people to edit at once and edit in real time with them.</li>
<li>Doing references with <a href="https://paperpile.com/app">Paperpile</a> was for the most part nice and easier than Endnote. I could easily search the web for citations, add papers directly to my collection from Pubmed, Google, journal websites, or just about anywhere. But see Cons...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figures!</strong> This is my major issue, and I have not figured out a good way. To encapsulate figure legends with the figures themselves, I ended up using a "drawing", which appears to be the only way to do this. In the beginning, this seemed good: I could arrange my figure and legend however I liked, put it in a nice box, and wrap text around it. The big shocker came when printing to PDF: all the figures turned to a resolution that made them look like a first grader drew them with a crayon. Apparently the drawings ignore the original image resolution, making this unavoidable. <strong>The solution: hours of my husband and I manually inserting figures into the PDF itself, after I had already promised myself I was done writing the grant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>References</strong> As I mentioned above, Paperpile is quite nice. However almost every time I inserted a citation, it would weirdly insert a double citation including the previous one as well. <strong>The solution: manually going through each of my dozens of citations to manually fix this</strong>.
<li><strong>Underlining</strong> There is a weird bug in which underlines that span more than one line individually underline each word, rather than the whole itself. Very annoying. <strong>The solution: be careful that none of my underlined phrases spanned a line break</strong>.
<li>There is no line count feature. Very annoying for sections that need to be less than X lines.</li>
<li>For some reason, the same text with the same specified margins takes up more room in Google docs than in Word.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the end, there was quite a bit of manually editing the PDF to make small changes. Not what I wanted to be doing in the last minute.
</p>
<p>
Google docs could make sense for collaborative editing where the google doc is not the final published product: e.g. manuscript drafts where figures are submitted separately anyway, or meeting agendas, etc. But until these issues are fixed I'm not sure I will stick with it for serious writing efforts. I was really hoping to make it work, so I'd love to hear people's thoughts on how to get around these issues!
