<strong>Summary</strong>: below I describe my frustration with current BAM alignment
viewers for looking at alignments of short reads to regions with
complex insertions and deletions, such as short tandem repeats. Then I
present <a href="http://melissagymrek.com/pybamview/">PyBamView</a>,
my weekend hack to build a lightweight, web-based alignment viewer
that provides an easy way to view sequence alignments across multiple
samples. This was largely inspired by the great but very basic,
<a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tview.shtml">samtools tview</a>, but with some added features and the
capability to add many more.
<p>
This is a taste of what it looks like:

<h2>Motivation, and existing alignment viewers</h2>
Most of my work during my PhD has focused on analyzing short tandem
repeats (STRs) from high throughput sequencing data. STRs are very repetitive and have large length differences
from the reference genome, and so can be hard to genotype. The example alignment at the beginning of this page shows a taste of what this can look like: in that example there are several reads showing a 15bp deletion at a (GTTTT) repeat, and one read showing a 10bp insertion.

<p>
When I started working on STRs, there was no good tool to genotype
(determine the number of repeats) these loci from sequencing
data. So one of my first projects in the Erlich lab was to develop a
tool, called <a href="http://jura.wi.mit.edu/erlich/lobSTR/">lobSTR</a> for
genotyping STRs.

<p>
One of the main ways of debugging a variant caller is by actually
going in and looking at the raw read alignments to see if you believe
the call. Let's see how three widely used genome browser tools
visualize alignments at STR variants (this is not a comprehensive list of alignment viewers, or of their features, just the ones I'm most familiar with.):

<ul>
<li><strong>Integrative Genomics Viewer</strong>
    (<a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">IGV</a>)</li>
Here are the alignments for two different STR loci:
<p>
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/igv_deletion.png" width="600">
<p>
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/igv_insertion.png" width="600">
<p>
In the first alignment, the reads indicate a deletion from the
reference allele. This is indicated with a bar showing a gap in the
alignment. It's very easy to tell that there's a deletion there.
<p>
In the second alignment, the reads indicate an insertion from the
reference allele. The insertion is shown as a purple bar. By mousing
over this purple bar, you can see the size of the insertion. Now what
you can't tell by looking at this is that the alignments here are for
an individual heterozygous for <em>two different alleles</em>, each of
which is an insertion compared to the reference genome. Because IGV
shows a "one size fits all" purple bar for indels, you wouldn't know
this from glancing at the alignment.

<li><strong>UCSC Genome Browser</strong> (<a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">view
    here</a>)
<p>
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/ucsc_deletion.png" width="600">
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/ucsc_insertion.png" width="600">
<p>

Similarly to IGV, here the deletions are nicely displayed in the bams, but the insertions are indicated by a small vertical bar (which is pretty hard to see in the pictures since it's so thin).

<li><strong>Samtools
    tview</strong> (<a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tview.shtml">sourceforge
    page</a>)</li>
Now we get to my personal favorite. Samtools tview is a very simple,
    fast, text-based alignment viewer run straight from the
    terminal. Just give it your indexed bam file and reference genome,
    and you get a lovely scrollable alignment. Let's look at how tview
    visualizes the two loci shown above:
<p>
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/tview_deletion.png" width="600">
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/tview_insertion.png" width="600">
<p>
This is exactly what I am looking for in terms of alignment
visualization (it looks better in the terminal than it does in the screen shots). Unlike the other viewers, samtools lets you visualize
the size of insertions, which it draws as *'s in the reference
genome. This is apparently very difficult for the other viewers to do,
probably since everything is based on the reference track
(see <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/igv-help/insertion$20visualization/igv-help/2GUJ0b8uYmc/uiPrVcEkZEQJ">this discussion on the IGV mailing</a> list
related to this issue.
<p>
Because tview is so minimal, it is super fast. Just enter the genomic region, snap your fingers, and
you're there. Unfortunately, that's about all you can do with tview: view an
alignment from a single bam file. None of the other useful features of
other browser such as adding more tracks with additional datasets,
viewing multiplpe alignments/tracks at once, etc.
</ul>

<h2>PyBamView</h2>
So what I <em><b>really</b></em> want is an alignment viewer that combines
the feature of samtools tview that I need (namely, good display of
indels) with some of the features of the more bulky alignment
viewers. Most importantly, I'd like to be able to view many samples at
once. Ideally, I'd like to have features allowing me to see metadata
about reads, and to combine the alignment views with information about
genotype calls.

<p>
I came across <a href="http://plindenbaum.blogspot.com/2013/01/samtools-tview-as-library-to-display-bam.html">this post on extending samtools tview to an
    HTML viewer</a>, and briefly considered trying to modify the
    samtools code to add some features. This idea didn't last very
    long after I forked
    the <a href="https://github.com/samtools">samtools github
    repository</a> and found most of the tview code had been
    temporarily commented out (although it did look like someone was
    making some efforts to use read groups to look at different
    samples). Uncommenting the tview code led to compilation errors,
    and I decided that Heng Li's (amazing) code is just a bit (a lot??)
    beyond my comfort level in C. So I decided to see if I could get
    something simple to work as a Python-based (of course!) web
    application.

<p>
Getting something primitive up and running was suprisingly simple. You
can view and play around with the example of what there is so
far <a href="http://bit.ly/pybamview-demo">here</a>
and get download/install/usage information <a href="http://melissagymrek.com/pybamview/">here</a>.
<p>
And here are the two loci used as examples above:
<p>
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/pybamview_deletion.png" width="600">
<img src="{{ SITE.URL }}/images/pybamview_insertion.png" width="600">
<p>
I have already found this super useful in visualizing our STR calls, and
it would likely be useful for people whose lives don't revolve around
STRs as well :).

If you want to hear more about how it works, and what I hope to add in
the future, keep reading!

<p>
P.S. I should have timed the process for how long it took me to get each of these running. PyBamView and tview took about 10 seconds each to load from the terminal. IGV and UCSC took <em>much</em> longer (although to be fair my slow internet at home is a lot to blame). Still for UCSC I had to upload my BAM file to a public URL, make a track, and load the page. For IGV, I had to launch IGV, figure out it doesn't work with my Java configuration, download from source, load the reference genome, and load my bam, all of which took much longer than I'm willing to admit.

<h2>PyBamView: how it works and what it does</h2>

PyBamView is a simple web application for visualizing alignments from
bam files. You supply it with bam files
on your local computer or server, along with an optional reference
genome, then view the alignments in your web browser. To call it from the
command line, simply type something like:

{% highlight bash %}
pybamview --bamdir $DIRECTORY_WITH_BAM_FILES --ref $REFERENCE_FASTA 
{% endhighlight %}

and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.

<h3>Flask for simple python web servers</h3>
PyBamView was built using the
Python <a href="flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> library, combined with
the <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">jinja2</a> template
engine. Using these tools, it is very easy to create an "application"
that ties specific python functions to call to generate the HTML (+
javascript, css, etc.) for specific URLs. For example, I can do
something like:

{% highlight python %}
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/<string:bamfiles>')
def display_bam(bamfiles):
  ... do something with bamfiles and generate html...
{% endhighlight %}

and generate the appropriate HTML using arguments parsed from the URL
  (in this example, I get the bamfiles from the URL, you can also
  easily use POST/GET requests). See tons more about this on the Flask site.

<h3>Displaying alignments</h3>

Read alignments are parsed from the CIGAR scores from the BAM file and displayed simply as HTML tables. There is a separate table for the reference genome at the top, and for each sample. Each column represents a position in the genome (mouseover a column to see which position it is). Gaps are displayed as "*"'s.

<p>
It would be pretty inefficient to load the whole human (or other) genome into your web browser, so PyBamView only loads chunks of the genomes at a time on demand. Because the BAM files are indexed, when given a genomic region we can immediately retrieve the reads in that region. This is done using the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pysam/">pysam</a> library. A buffer of several hundred base pairs around the request region is loaded so you can scroll a little upstream and downstream of the region input to the search bar.

<h2>Future developments</h2>

There are many things on the todo list. On the immediate list to add
is:
<ul>
<li>Highlight base mismatches from the reference genome</li>
<li>Deal with cases in bam files that aren't dealt with yet (clipping,
  etc.)</li>
</ul>

In the more distant future, I'd like to add more ways to visualize
read metadata (click on a read, see info about it's tags. Also,
visualization of reads that are paired), and ultimately to add integration with calls from VCF files.
<p>
