Intro - TODO
lots of talk about reproducible research:
  cite nature series, other articles about this, my previous blog post

some papers have started publishing data/code to go with figures and
analysis (put some examples)

this is the beginning, but not there yet: need a way to make results
easily reproducible, in a way that others can interact with

outline of what I talk about
say the goal of providing all the analysis for a paper encapsulated in
a docker
say I'd love to have open discussion about this, what would be the
best way to publish paper like this

<h2>Challenges in providing easily reproducible results</h2>
challenges: want to be reproducible, but also that it is *easy* for
others to reproduce it, else it's not useful and no one will waste
their time
burden is on the author to make this easy, not just to hand the
scripts off and say good luck
will make for better code, more accountability, and research that is
more useful to other people

<h2>Using docker for reproducible analyses</h2>

say what docker is
why it can be useful for this: provide an environment where everything
is already set up. don't send me chasing some obscure libraries,
etc. can run anywhere

figshare reproducible research pdf

say how I would do it (Github repo for a paper, have Dockerfile there,
separate data directory)
makefile to get all results? several options to discuss

<h2>Challenges</h2>
requires that bioinformaticians become knowledgeable in this stuff,
but that will make us better coders anyway
really huge datasets that require the cloud - at least provide small examples?
data access problems - again, provide small examples, separate code
from the data, ppl want to download data separately anyway

<h2>Example - reproducing Martin, et al. PLOS Genetics 2014</h2>
took as example these guys, give big kudos for putting code/scripts
online
still challenges: need to install libraries, code not production
ready, etc.
repoduced 2 figures (which ones?)
here I did rstudio since their code is in R. could do same thing with
IPython, make file etc.

basically, set up a docker to run rstudio, has the code
loaded. provide separate data dir
docker set up with all the paths etc. it needs

<h3>Run the docker yourself</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
