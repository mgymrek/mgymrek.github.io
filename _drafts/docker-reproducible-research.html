Intro - TODO

<h2>Challenges in providing easily reproducible results</h2>
cite nature series, other articles about this

<h2>Using docker for reproducible analyses</h2>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<h2>Example - reproducing Martin, et al. PLOS Genetics 2014</h2>

<h3>Run the docker yourself</h3>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

figshare reproducible research pdf

write demo research article (what to write about??)
each result mouseover and get the make target
each figure mouseover and see the ipython nb that produces it
provide data zip and docker
docker has all the installed code + ipython notebooks
instructions to run it

Example analysis:
reproduce bustamante paper: http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004549

Challenges:
really huge datasets that require cloud computing?

Other points:
burden is on the author to make reproducibilty easy, not just to hand scripts and say good luck
