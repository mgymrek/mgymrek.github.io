figshare reproducible research pdf

write demo research article (what to write about??)
each result mouseover and get the make target
each figure mouseover and see the ipython nb that produces it
provide data zip and docker
docker has all the installed code + ipython notebooks
instructions to run it

Example analysis:
reproduce bustamante paper: http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004549

Challenges:
really huge datasets that require cloud computing?
